Data Distribution

A python code for a youtube dataset was generated in html format and ipynb format. The html file explains how to calculate the distribution of a particular column (channeltype) out of the top 1000 records and presents a graphical illustration. The ipynb file has the same details and can be run with the appropriate software.

## Prerequisites
