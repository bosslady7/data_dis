Data Distribution

A test trial of creating a readme for a python code that is in html format and ipynb format. The html file explains how to calculate the distribution of a column out of the top 1000 records and presents a graphical illustration. The ipynb file has the same details and can be run with the appropriate software.

## Prerequisites

A browser is required to view the html file. Download the latest version of Anaconda software to practice running the ipynb file of the code using Jupyter note.
